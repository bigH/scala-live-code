Scala Template
==============

A simple template with a single module to get started building awesome Scala projects.

Usage
-----

 - `git clone https://github.com/bigH/scala-template.git my-project`
 - `cd my-project`
 - `bin/sbt console` will open a console to enable you to experiment
 - `bin/sbt eclipse` will generate an Eclipse project
 - `bin/sbt gen-idea` will generate an IntelliJ project
 - `bin/sbt ~test` will run all tests when project changes

See [the `mongo-gen` project](`https://github.com/bigH/mongo-gen`) for an example of a multi-module project built using this template. The project is as of now still incomplete, but has plenty of examples of what I think is good scala code.
